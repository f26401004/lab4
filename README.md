	the encoded identifiers are:

	000000000040055b T main
	000000000040052d T _Z7averageiRf
	00000000004004ed T _Z7averagePdRd

	Because the meaning of a pointer is to read the memory address in the computer, and the type decides the way to read it.
	That means, I can use a char pointer point to an integer variable, however the data it reads may not be the data expected.
	So, the size of a pointer must be the largest size in order to meet different types.
